\section{Actor Collaboration Diagram}
Notes:
\begin{itemize}
\item\ [N] means N copies of the indicated actor, where N is an integer.
\item\ [*] is zero or more, [+] is one or more
\item Actors can be circles, ellipses, or rounded-rectangles---but be consistent!
\item Messages sent as responses are shown with dotted lines, physically close to the triggering message.
\item Use whatever drawing tool you are most familiar with, then copy and paste the actor collaboration diagram.
